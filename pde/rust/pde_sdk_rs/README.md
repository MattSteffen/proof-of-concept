# PDE SDK - Rust Backend

High-performance Rust backend for the PDE SDK, providing finite difference solvers for common PDEs.

## Features

- 1D and 2D uniform grid solvers
- Heat equation with explicit Euler method
- PyO3 integration with Python
- Optional parallel computation with Rayon

## Usage

This crate provides PyO3 bindings for use from Python. The main entry point is the `pde_sdk_rust` Python module.

## Development

See the main PDE SDK repository for development instructions.
