I want to create a project that tries to predict individualized muscle growth maximization based on the following factors:
- Estimating muscle fiber type composition
- estimating stregngth and quantity of time close to failure.


Meathead project: estimate the density of muscle fiber types.  Based on how fast strength drops off and endurance drops off and how fast size grows. Assumptions are the distribution of types effect the strength endurance.
